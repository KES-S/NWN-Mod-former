Unlike previous releases of the DMFI tools, there is no requirement for an NPC, summoned creature, familiar or "voice" to be within range for these functions to work.

Repeated text is ALWAYS ignored (ie in testing hi, hi, hi)

BASIC VOICE FUNCTIONS:
-----------------------------------------
**DM channel no longer used**
There is no longer a requirement to speak your special command on the DM channel. You may use the special modifiers below on the Talk, Whisper, or Party channel.

[your typing here]

Enclosing text in square brackets will speak your "native" language.  If you have more than one, use the language widgets to set the language you will be speaking.

;your text here

Starting your text with a semicolon will cause your familiar or companion to say your text.

,your text here

Starting your text with a semicolon will cause your summoned creature will say your text.


*emotes*
--------------
Bracketing text between two * will attempt to perform an emote.  This applies to simple spoken text by the PC.

This will work for DM possessed creatures or for players.  The action will be taken by the speaker.

Two uses:  

1) is for skill checks or ability checks - ie *uses strength to move rock*

2) is for emotes - ie *bows to the leader of the town*

Two emotes animation shortcuts:

.emon  - animations NO
.emoy  - animations YES

Appropriate actions include:

All abilities and all skills (spell them just like the actual skill or ability - ie use magic device)

Emote animations:

agree
beg, plead
bends, stoops
bored, scratch
bow
cantrip
cheer, hooray, celebrate

.broadcast commands
-----------------------------------

These commands will change how dicerolls are reported for .skill rolls and for rolls performed by the DMFI DM Dicebag

.dm           - DM send only
.private     - DM and player
.local         - roll is given via TALK
.global       - roll is given via SHOUT

Two dice-roll animation shortcuts:

.anin  - animations NO
.aniy  - animations YES

Set yourself or associate to speak a particular language
EX:  .lan drow
