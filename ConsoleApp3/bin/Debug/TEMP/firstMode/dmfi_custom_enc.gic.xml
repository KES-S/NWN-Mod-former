This waypoint is used to create custom encounters that can be  called from the DMFI Encounter wand.

The TAG should be "DMFI_E (followed by the number, 1-9, for that custom encounter.

You can change the name and it shows up in the encounter conversation to help you remember what is what.

To create a new custom encounter, place a waypoint with the appropriate tag and then place monsters (up to 8) within 10 meters of the waypoint.  These are the monsters that will be spawned when that encounter is called.

The area with the encounter templates must NOT have any players EVER in that region.  If they enter that region, then the monsters begin to move around (DM's don't count).

The encounter does NOT have scaling or probabilities to change the distribution.  What you place is what you get, but you can change the encounters as the module progresses by using the DM client creator and you can set up to 9 different ones at a time using 9 different waypoint tags.]]></value>

1. Create the creature and either use its current Tag or fill in a new one.
2. Place or make sure the WalkWayPoints() is within the body of the On Spawn script for the creature.
3. Place a series of waypoints along the route you wish the creature to walk.
4. Select all of the newly created waypoints and right click. Choose the Create Set option.
5. The waypoint set will have a set name of "WP_" + NPC Tag. Thus if an NPC with the Tag "Guard" will have a waypoint set called "WP_Guard". Note that Tags are case sensitive.]]></value>
